# VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES:

'''

Example:

x = 5 (# x is of type integer)
y = "John" (# y is of type string)
z = 'a' (# z is also of type string)
q = 3.14 (# q is of type float)
v = 3.14325633333 (# v is of type double)
p = 3000000000000080000000000000000000 (# p is of type long)
b = True (# b is of type boolean. its value can be false as well)
c = 1j (# c is of type complex)

print(c)
print(b)
print(p)
print(v)
print(q)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

'''

# HOW TO FIND THE TYPE:

'''

Example:

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

a = 4
A = "Sally"

A will not overwrite a , Both are different Variables.

'''

# VARIABLES CAN BE ASSIGNED IN A SINGLE LINE:

'''

Example:

x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

'''

# MULTIPLE VARIABLES CAN BE GIVEN SAME VALUES:

'''

Example:

x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

'''

# WE CAN USE ',' AND '+' OPERATOR TO OUTPUT MULTIPLE VARIABLES:

'''

Example:

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

'''

# WE CAN ALSO PERFORM ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS ON DIFFERENT VARIABLES:

'''

Example:

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
