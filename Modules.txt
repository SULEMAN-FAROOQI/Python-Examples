A module is a file containing python code, It may contain functions, classes and other stuff.

To use the functions of a module, write: 
  'import <Name of the module>'.

Also if you want to access some fuctions or classes from a module write:
  'from <Name of the module> import <Name of the function or classes>'
By doing so you don't have to initialize ( <Name of the module>.<Name of the function or classes> ) the module.
You just have to write the name of the function or class to perform the task.

Python have a list of built-in modules, If you need to access them write: 'help("modules")' and it will print all 
the modules for us.
